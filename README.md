I'm a full stack software developer based in Nashville, Tennessee. My journey into tech began with an early passion for design, HTML & CSS. I recently graduated from Nashville Software School last year with a certificate in full stack web developent program with a newfound love for web development and tech. I'm currently looking for work opportunities and to connect with other developers!
